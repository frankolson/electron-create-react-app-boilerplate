# Electron `create-react-app` Boilerplate:

For bootstrapping electron projects with React and Webpack.

## Getting Started

### Install and deploy

```shell
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/frankolson/electron-create-react-app-boilerplate.git project-name
cd project-name
yarn
yarn start
```

This will start the app in development mode and automatically launch the first window.

The app will reload if you make edits and you will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
